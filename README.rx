# readmix

{{ "readmix" | NpmLink }} is a command-line `README` generator.

You can find the source code at {{ "iaseth/readmix" | GithubLink }}.


## Props

Every `rx` file has access to the global `Rx` object with the following properties:
{{ Rx | PrintPropsTable }}

Every `property` on the `Rx` object is also available globally.
So, you can just write `appName` instead of `Rx.appName`.


## Utility Functions

In addition to props, the `Rx` object also contains a `utils` object with the following utility `functions`:
{{ Rx.utils | PrintFunctionsTable }}

Every `function` on the `Rx.utils` object is also available globally.
So, you can just write `giveCredit()` instead of `Rx.utils.giveCredit()` or `utils.giveCredit()`.


## Filters

In addition to default filters in `nunjucks`, `Readmix` provides you with these additional `filters`:
{{ Rx.filters | PrintFiltersTable }}
Each `filter` is available globally.
